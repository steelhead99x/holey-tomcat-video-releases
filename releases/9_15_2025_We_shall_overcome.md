## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the song *"We Shall Overcome"*, learned on a 5-string banjo from a book by Pete Seeger. The song’s message of resilience and hope has guided the creator through challenges, channeling negative energies into positive outcomes. Technology, much like music, is a tool—its impact depends on the people behind it. This platform reflects a commitment to building a brighter future through innovation and collaboration.
